==> postgresql@15
This formula has created a default database cluster with:
  initdb --locale=C -E UTF-8 /opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@15
For more details, read:
  https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/app-initdb.html

postgresql@15 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have postgresql@15 first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@15/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find postgresql@15 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@15/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@15/include"

To start postgresql@15 now and restart at login:
  brew services start postgresql@15
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  LC_ALL="C" /opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@15/bin/postgres -D /opt/homebrew/var/postgresql@15
